    // investigation found the OOM was NOT a coverage-provider or heap-flag issue
    // (istanbul, v8, every pool permutation, and even coverage-DISABLED all
    // OOM'd) — the actual trigger was a single pathological test:
    // pages.test.tsx > LoginPage mocked useAuth() to return an authenticated
    // user, so LoginPage's redirect-if-authenticated effect fired navigate() on
    // every render and — because the mock returned a fresh object each call —
    // the effect's [user] dep changed every render, spinning an infinite
    // render loop that ballooned to ~5.6GB. That test bug is fixed; the full
    // suite now completes at ~500MB.
    //
    // For durable memory headroom (and to keep cross-file-polluting pairs in
    // separate processes) the CI coverage run is sharded: `pnpm test:coverage`
    // → scripts/coverage-sharded.mjs runs the suite as 2 fresh vitest processes
    // (vitest.shard.config.ts) and merges their istanbul coverage. This base
    // config still drives `pnpm test` / `test:watch` and is inherited by the
    // shard config. maxForks:1 keeps a single non-sharded run bounded too.
    // Vitest 4 removed `poolOptions` — the per-pool settings are top-level
